# My Python Project

 is a web application for team planning in a Pokemon game.

The Pokemon TeamPlanner app allows users to create and manage Pokemon teams, and to view information about types, moves, and abilities.

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the project dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Set up the configuration file `config.json` to modifying the settings if needed.
4. Start the application by running `flask --debug run`.

## What I learned

1. Redis (storing information in cach√©)
2. Blueprints in Flask (for improving organization of files)
3. Authentication of users, login, register and logout.
4. Good Architectural patterns
5. Database Management
